    <h1 align="center">Welcome to Latena!</h1>
    <h2 align="center">This is a random cat. Enjoy! (Source: <a href="https://cataas.com/cat">Cataas</a>)</h2>
    <p><img src="https://cataas.com/cat" align="right" class="rightimg"> <br> Why did I post this picture? 
      Because cats are the national animals of Latena. This is not surprising: they are so funny little cuties :)
      Cats also help us to do our magic deals.
      Anyway, I would like to tell about <b><i>Latena</i></b> first. You will ask me probably: why don't you tell about magic first?
      Fine, <a href="#magic">here is your access</a>.</p>
    <p id="latena"> So, Latena is a country in Europe</p>
   <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
    <p id="magic">So, you are here! I am pretty impressed if you read the information before :). Even I wrote about magic firstly :D
      I am not supposed to tell about our magic spells in the safety purpose. I may only tell about form of our magic though.
      All Latena's citizens can use magic. Everyone has their own additional magic ability, too.
      You prove it in a special test center along with doing your magic exams (which is a must to become a licence)
      Every magic can be done with a special bracelet, or, when you are strong enough, with a ring.
      But a magic ability is coming from YOU and it is supposed to work without any artefacts! 
      <br>
      Some advice for you:
      <ul>
         <li> Make up the second secret full name. It's the name for contracts and spells. With other people, use your other name.</li>
         <li> ALWAYS READ EVERYTHING AND THE FINE PRINT BEFORE SIGNING ANYTHING!!!</li>
         <li> The one unbreakable physics law is the Law of Energy Saving.<li>
      </ul>
