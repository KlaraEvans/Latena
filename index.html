    <p><img src="https://cataas.com/cat" class="rightimg"> <br> Why did I post this picture? 
      Because cats are the national animals of Latena. This is not surprising: they are so funny little cuties :)
      Cats also help us to do our magic deals.
      Anyway, I would like to tell about <b><i>Latena</i></b> first. You will ask me probably: why don't you tell about magic first?
      Fine, <a href="#magic">here is your access</a>.
      So, Latena is a country in Europe.

    <p id="magic">So, you are here! I am pretty impressed if you read the information before :). Even I wrote about magic firstly. :D
      I am not supposed to tell about our magic spells in the safety purpose. I may tell about form of our magic though.
      Everyone in Latena may and can use magic except of some prisoners. But everyone has their own additional magic ability. For example, I am an Editor.
