    <h1 align="center">Welcome to Latena!</h1>

    <p><img src="https://cataas.com/cat" align="right" class="rightimg"> <br> Why did I post this picture? 
      Because cats are the national animals of Latena. This is not surprising: they are so funny little cuties :)
      Cats also help us to do our magic deals.
      Anyway, I would like to tell about <b><i>Latena</i></b> first. You will ask me probably: why don't you tell about magic first?
      Fine, <a href="#magic">here is your access</a>.</p>
    <p id="latena"> So, Latena is a country in Europe</p>

    <p id="magic">So, you are here! I am pretty impressed if you read the information before :). Even I wrote about magic firstly :D
      I am not supposed to tell about our magic spells in the safety purpose. I may only tell about form of our magic though.
      Latena's citizens may can use magic except of some prisoners. However, everyone has their own additional magic ability, too. 
      You prove it in a special test center along with doing your magic exams. 
      Every magic can be done with a special bracelet, or, when you are strong enough, with a ring. 
      But a magic ability is only YOURS and it is supposed to work without any artefacts!
      Remember that physics also exist ðŸ˜œ. That means, because of energy saving and trasforming law, 
      magic requires energy, but it cannot be created or destroyed. We often use our own energy or energy 
      of the surrounding subjects (using energy of other people without their permission is forbidden).
      Oh, I totally forgot! Here are known ability types:

      <a href="https://www.hvf-bs.net"> Hoffman von Fallersleben Schule </a> (German-speaking magic gymnasium in Brunsviga) will provide you with further information if you are interested. 
      But they could cast a special spell on you in order to prevent you from telling something unwanted.
      Some advice for you:
      <ul>
         <li> Make up the second secret full name. It's the name for contracts and spells. With other people, use your other name.</li>
         <li> ALWAYS READ EVERYTHING AND THE FINE PRINT BEFORE SIGNING ANYTHING!!!</li>
      </ul>
